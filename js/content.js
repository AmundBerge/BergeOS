<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Amund Dahlmo Berge, and I'm a 20-year-old Norwegian CS student. My interests include
programming, piano, sports, and chess. BergeOS is my personal website, intended both as an archive 
of various aspects of my life, as well as displaying these to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As life goes on, I want to post monthly life updates here, review various 
media I consume, as well as include my writings on various topics.</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Well, I currently don't have any real projects to show for.

    <li>Chess engine</li>

    <li>To go some period using my phone and computer only for basic communication, school, other essentials, and nothing else</li>
</ul>

const pianoContent = `
<h1>Piano</h1>
<p>Playing the piano is my primary hobby and one of my greatest passions. After having
no proper access to a piano during my first year at university, my skills have tanked 
a bit. This will hopefully change soon, as I will bring my electric piano to my student
apartment. To celebrate this, I want to upload some piano videos to YouTube. It will be 
a mix of me freshening up old pieces, playing various piano covers, as well as making my 
own one day. For now, though, we will have to wait.</p>
`
const videoContent = `
<h1>Videos</h1>
<p>I want to make a YouTube channel where I plan to upload piano videos, funny videos to 
troll my friends, and whatever else I deem worthy. Though I have no plans of becoming a
youtuber, uploading some videos coincides with my goal of documenting more of my life and 
it is going to be fun, too (hopefully).</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
