<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Amund Dahlmo Berge, and I'm a 20-year-old Norwegian CS student. My interests include
programming, piano, sports, and chess. BergeOS is my personal website, intended both as an archive 
of various aspects of my life, as well as displaying these to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As life goes on, I want to post monthly life updates here, review various 
media I consume, as well as include my writings on various topics.</p>
