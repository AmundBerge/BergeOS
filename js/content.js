<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Amund Dahlmo Berge, and I'm a 20-year-old Norwegian CS student. My interests include
programming, piano, sports, and chess. BergeOS is my personal website, intended both as an archive 
of various aspects of my life, as well as displaying these to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As life goes on, I want to post monthly life updates here, review various 
media I consume, as well as include my writings on various topics.</p>

    <li>To go some period using my phone and computer only for basic communication, school, other essentials, and nothing else</li>
</ul>

const pianoContent = `
<h1>Piano</h1>
<p>Playing the piano is my primary hobby and one of my greatest passions. After having
no proper access to a piano during my first year at university, my skills have tanked 
a bit. This will hopefully change soon, as I will bring my electric piano to my student
apartment. To celebrate this, I want to upload some piano videos to YouTube. It will be 
a mix of me freshening up old pieces, playing various piano covers, as well as making my 
own one day. For now, though, we will have to wait.</p>
`
const videoContent = `
<h1>Videos</h1>
<p>I want to make a YouTube channel where I plan to upload piano videos, funny videos to 
troll my friends, and whatever else I deem worthy. Though I have no plans of becoming a
youtuber, uploading some videos coincides with my goal of documenting more of my life and 
it is going to be fun, too (hopefully).</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<h1>My Favorite Music</h1>

<p>Here you will find some of my favorite pieces of music. I try not to include too many pieces from the same genre.</p>

<h3>Bach - Pi√®ce d'Orgue BWV 572</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_Nu2cDYvUQ?si=mYi2T9d07rqwLa-H" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>My favorite piece of all time. Played here by Leo van Doeselaar.<p>

<h3>Portwave - Shadow Lady</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQArLobRrt8?si=7uvmbHIbsmBBKFwc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>An electronic piece. It fits well under the synthwave subgenre.</p>

<h3>Sienna Sleep - I Can't Sleep 2</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1GrFHrwaMY?si=W9EjkolVbs1W5kdd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Another electronic piece. Trance music of this style is sometimes referred to as "sextrance". A goofy name for a genre, but at least the music is good...</p>

<h3>Still - Divinity</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mULhXNLh25k?si=aR-viUIGiAn9Q-7z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Post-punk. The band has a very small following, so I am happy to have discovered them. </p>

<h3>Toshiki Kadomatsu - 52nd Street</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIFASfPkw9g?si=sjblzQ3GzPgvZNFx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Instrumental city pop music. I especially like the part that starts at 2:08. </p>

<h3>Fire and Ice - Souvenir De Chine</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbiWENuqo10?si=tfofv65Bky0d-S7b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Another trance piece. This time it is vanilla trance. </p>

<h3>Kino - Song Without Words</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6ksxfWx6zE?si=3lh5mL3hSvoPMoKD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Russian alternative rock music (I do not know any Russian). What I love the most about this song is how it concludes with repeating the same sequence over and over again. </p>

<h3>Bach - Fantasia and fugue in G minor BWV 542</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgDE3klkmtQ?si=5MSC4XfdGKom-svN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Had this been an authentic "my favorite music" list, at least half of the pieces would have been organ works by Bach. I therefore had the need to include at least one more piece by Bach. Played by Leo van Doeselaar, once again. </p>

<h3>Demetori - Eastern Dream</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3sm6RcBpXU?si=0RymcOzRCk22G3Y1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>I discovered Demetori through various gaming videos, where their music is sometimes used as background music. Eastern Dream is an emotional 10-minute long rock ballad. </p>

<h3>Leslie Parrish - Killing My Love</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdYwICNPDwI?si=wXBxTmfdzsY68MWL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>My favorite Eurobeat song. I have a goal of writing a piano cover of this song one day. </p>

<h3>Animenz - Unravel</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEQf5lcnj_o?si=GbElyYu9RT-aj-Zb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Animenz is one of my greatest musical idols. His cover of Unravel is his most popular video, and for good reason. </p>

<h3>Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence</h3>
<div class="iframe_container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OZDaRhHHyM?si=60Xnk1t2lgmOVS2D" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>One of my favorite pieces from my favorite modern-era composer. I have played this piece myself on numerous occasions and gatherings. </p>
