# BergeOS

## Description
BergeOS is my personal website. It serves as both a personal archive and a way of sharing aspects of my life to the rest of the world. The website is written in vanilla JavaScript, and it is designed to mimic a desktop screen. You can view the website on [My Vercel App](https://berge-os.vercel.app).
