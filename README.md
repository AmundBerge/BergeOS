# BergeOS

## Description
BergeOS is my personal website. It serves as both a personal archive and a way of sharing things to the rest of the world. The website is written in vanilla JavaScript, and it is designed to mimic an old desktop screen. You can view the website on [Github Pages](https://amundberge.github.io/BergeOS/).
